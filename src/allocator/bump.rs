// Bump Allocator:
// The most simple allocator design is a bump allocator (also known as stack allocator). It allocates
// memory linearly and only keeps track of the number of allocated bytes and the number of allocations.

// Biggest  Advantage:  itâ€™s very fast. Compared to other allocator designs (see below) that need to
// actively look for a fitting memory block and perform various bookkeeping tasks on alloc and dealloc, a
//  bump allocator can be optimized to just a few assembly instructions. This makes bump allocators useful
//  for optimizing the allocation performance, for example when creating a virtual DOM library.
